import splitfolders: This line imports the splitfolders library, which is used for splitting datasets into train, validation, and test sets.

splitfolders.ratio(: This calls the ratio() function from the splitfolders library. It is used to perform the dataset split.

"TB_Chest_Radiography_Database": This is the path to the input folder containing the dataset you want to split. You need to replace this with the actual path to your dataset.

output="tuberculosisdata": This specifies the path to the output folder where the split dataset will be saved. In this case, the dataset will be split into three subfolders: "train", "val", and "test" inside the "tuberculosisdata" folder.

seed=1337: This sets the random seed used for shuffling the dataset before splitting. By setting a specific seed (in this case, 1337), you can ensure that the same dataset split will be generated each time you run the code.

ratio=(.7, .2, .1): This specifies the split ratios for the train, validation, and test sets, respectively. In this case, 70% of the data will be used for training, 20% for validation, and 10% for testing.

group_prefix=None: This parameter is set to None, which means the class/group folders in the input folder will not be prefixed in the output folders. If you have class/group folders in your input dataset and you want to maintain them in the output folders, you can provide a string value for group_prefix.
