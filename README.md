# Mini-Project
# “ IMPLEMENTATION OF TRAINING MODEL FOR TUBERCULOSIS DETECTION USING CNN”
# Abstract
Tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health problem worldwide, particularly in developing
countries where the burden of the disease is highest. The early detection and accurate diagnosis of
TB are crucial for successful treatment and prevention of the spread of the disease. However,
traditional methods of TB diagnosis, such as sputum microscopy and culture, are time-consuming,
labor-intensive, and require specialized laboratory equipment and trained personnel. Therefore,
there is a need for faster, more efficient, and accurate methods for TB diagnosis. In recent years,
machine learning algorithms, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown
great potential for the detection of TB using medical images, such as chest radiographs.
# Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB) remains a public health problem, even after 100 years of discovery of the
microorganism, highly effective drugs and vaccines are available. It is classified as one of
the top ten reasons for death from an infectious agent according to WHO.
In this study, we propose a system for the detection of TB using CNN architecture. The
system takes user input in the form of chest radiographs. The uploaded images are then pre-
processed to remove any noise or artifacts, and fed into the CNN model for classification.
The CNN model was trained on a large dataset of chest radiographs to detect the presence
of TB. The model architecture consisted of multiple convolutional and pooling layers,
followed by fully connected layers for classification.
# Literature Survey
1.&quot;Detection of Tuberculosis from Chest Radiograph using Deep Learning: A Systematic
Review and Meta-analysis&quot; by V.G. Nair et al. (2020)
Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Chest
radiographs (CXRs) are commonly used in TB diagnosis, and machine learning (ML)
algorithms, especially deep learning (DL), have shown promise in CXR-based TB
detection. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, they evaluate the performance of
DL-based algorithms for TB detection from CXR. They found that DL-based algorithms
had high sensitivity and specificity in detecting TB from CXR, with an overall pooled
sensitivity of 92.2% and specificity of 90.4%. Their findings suggest that DL-based
algorithms have the potential to improve TB diagnosis, particularly in resource-limited
settings.
2. &quot;Automatic Tuberculosis Screening System Based on Deep Learning and Chest X-Ray Images&quot;
by Y. Zhang et al. (2021)
Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health problem, and early detection is critical for effective
treatment and disease control. In this study, we propose an automatic TB screening system based
on deep learning and chest X-ray images. The system uses a convolutional neural network (CNN)
to classify chest X-ray images as either TB-positive or TB-negative. They evaluated the system on
a dataset of 662 TB-positive and 662 TB-negative chest X-ray images.
3. &quot;Tuberculosis Detection from Chest Radiographs Using Convolutional Neural Networks: A
Survey&quot; by S. Zafar et al. (2020)
Tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health issue worldwide, and chest radiographs (CXRs) are
commonly used in TB diagnosis. Machine learning (ML) algorithms, particularly convolutional
neural networks (CNNs), have shown promise in CXR-based TB detection. In this survey, they
review the state-of-the-art in CNN-based TB detection from CXR, including pre-processing
techniques, network architectures, and evaluation metrics. They also discussed the challenges and
limitations of current approaches, and highlight future research directions.
